<h3><p  style=font-size:45px;color:Brown;font-family:gabriola;>What Do We Do?</p></h3>
<p   style=font-size:25px;color:darkblue;font-family:sans-serif;>Complete Wedding + Events does more than just wedding and event photography. We believe that all of your special events call for photos that help bring you back to that once-in-a-lifetime moment. These are some of our favorite events to photograph: <br><br>
    1)Weddings are always special. Celebrating the love between two people is a beautiful privilege that we take very seriously. We are here to help make sure that your wedding photography tells the perfect story of you and the people you love.<br><br>
    2)Whether you are celebrating a milestone birthday or if you just want to have the birthday bash of the season, we want to be there to capture it all! Our special event photographers make sure that they are in the right place to capture the best moments at any birthday celebration.<br><br>
    3)Corporate events are not usually something that you think about having a photographer at. However, the right special event photographer can become a marketing partner. Taking photos at a corporate event can really showcase the best side of your business and create marketing photos that allow your clients to see that, too.<br><br>
    4)Bat and Bar Mitzvahs are another place where event photography really creates memories that will be cherished forever. Having us there to capture this all-important time in your family allows you to be fully present at the ceremony instead of worrying about capturing the moment.<br><br>
